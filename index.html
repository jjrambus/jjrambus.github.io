        <p>I am a hard-working college student (Computer Science/Information Systems Management)
          currently attending Auburn University. During the course of my academic career
          I have had the opportunity to learn in several classes key computer science principles
          relevant to any Software Engineering role. Most of my academic experience has been
          with Java but I have found time on my own to gain experience with several other programming languages and frameworks
          such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (used to build my website you're looking at right now).
          An overview of these skills can be found on my <a id = "resumeLink" href="images/Joshua_Rambus_resume.pdf">resum√©</a>.
          I have also had the privilege of working for Booz-Allen Hamilton in a Summer Games Intern role
          during the Summer of 2019, where I learned valuable professional skills such as
          programming, web platform development, and application development.
          In both my academic and professional life, I have been consistently
          praised as focused by my professors and peers. Whether working on academic,
           extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven problem-solving,
           teamwork, and creative thinking skills. </p>
