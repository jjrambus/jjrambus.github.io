    Development. I have several online course certifications for both mobile
    and web developmentthat include: iOS development using Swift,
    React-Native, Angular, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and much more that can be

    website completely from scratch to showcase several projects that I have
    worked on. I also have experience developing in a professional environment.
