        <p id="intro">Hello my name is Joshua Rambus and I am a student at Auburn
          University studying Management of Information Systems and Copmuter Science.
          I am passionate about Full-Stack Web Development and Mobile Application
          Development. I have several online course certifications for both mobile
          and web developmentthat include: iOS development using Swift,
          React-Native, Angular, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and much more that can be
          found on my <a href="http://jjrambus.github.io/images/resume.pdf">
            <strong>resum√©</strong></a>! I also used these skills to develop this
          website completely from scratch to showcase several projects that I have
          worked on. I also have experience developing in a professional environment.
          Below are just a few projects that I have built myself! You can find the
          rest of my work at
          my personal github repository <a href="https://github.com/jjrambus">here.
